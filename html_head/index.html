      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        I came out of the University of Tulsa School of Art. I studied a handful of disciplines but ultimately got my Bachelor of Fine Arts emphasis in digital media.<br>After graduating, I worked for a few years in a software and marketing firm doing graphic design, video editing, and creating 3D floor plans. Then I worked another couple years for an Oakland-based company creating 3D models of eyeglasses.<br>I wasn't wholly unsatisfied doing this kind of work, but the pay never was great, and finding new opportunities within my wheelhouse has historically been kind of hard.<br>That said, I've always been into "digital" stuff, and more than half my friends were already somewhere in the software industry, so it made sense once I had the chance to try to expand what I was capable of by applying to Holberâ€” I mean Atlas!
