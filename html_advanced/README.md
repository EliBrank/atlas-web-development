# HTML Advanced

This project is meant to display a purposeful translation of a web page layout (delivered using Figma) into basic HTML. The HTML here is unstyled but maintains the proper outline of the page for future styling with CSS. This will demonstrate some essential concepts such as:
  - How to create an HTML page from a wireframe  
  - What is a markup language  
  - What is the DOM  
  - What is an element/tag, and what is their purpose  
  - What is an attribute
